# Stats setup

The following should yield all the R packages needed to run the stats analysis:

```shell
conda install -c conda-forge r-tidyverse r-afex r-lme4 r-emmeans r-optimx r-dfoptim
```

You will need to modify the file path to use the local CSV file, by default it's set to a path specific to our analysis server.
